# Word-Guess-Game

This project is about artists with top songs from the 1970's through 2010 (4 decades).  It randomly chooses a song and artist and gives you blanks to fill in to spell the name of the ARTIST - sort of like a cross between Hangman and Wheel of fortune.  If you correctly guess the artist, you will hear a snip of one of their top songs.
